  "overall_score": 6,
  "summary": "The login screen is clean and basic, but usability is hindered by issues with visual hierarchy, unclear alternative login buttons, and insufficient emphasis on important actions (e.g., forgot password, sign up). Minor inconsistencies in contrast and affordance affect accessibility and learnability.",
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": "issue_1",
      "element": "Alternative login buttons (G, f, X)",
      "issue": "The icons for alternative login options are not clearly labeled. Users unfamiliar with these symbols may not know their meaning or purpose.",
      "principle": "Recognition rather than recall, Consistency & Standards",
      "severity": 4,
      "recommendation": "Add clear text labels below or inside each icon (e.g., 'Google', 'Facebook', 'Apple/Twitter/X' depending on actual intent) and ensure icons follow standard brand guidelines."
    },
    {
      "id": "issue_2",
      "element": "'Forgot Password?' link",
      "issue": "The link is very faint and almost invisible due to low contrast against the white background, making it easy to miss.",
      "principle": "Accessibility, Visibility of system status",
      "severity": 4,
      "recommendation": "Increase contrast and font weight to ensure the link is clearly visible and accessible."
    },
    {
      "id": "issue_3",
      "element": "'Sign Up' link",
      "issue": "The sign-up prompt is not visually distinct or actionable; users may not realize it is a tappable element.",
      "principle": "Affordance, Visibility of system status",
      "severity": 3,
      "recommendation": "Underline or color the 'Sign Up' text or style it as a button to indicate interactivity."
    },
    {
      "id": "issue_4",
      "element": "Password input field",
      "issue": "There is no visible option to reveal the password, which can reduce error prevention and is a common usability expectation.",
      "principle": "Error prevention, Flexibility & efficiency of use",
      "severity": 2,
      "recommendation": "Add a 'show/hide password' icon inside the password input field."
    },
    {
      "id": "issue_5",
      "element": "Visual hierarchy of actions (LOGIN button vs. other actions)",
      "issue": "Secondary actions ('Forgot Password?', 'Sign Up') are less visible due to their color and size, making primary and secondary actions difficult to distinguish.",
      "principle": "Visual hierarchy, Visibility of system status",
      "severity": 2,
      "recommendation": "Use color contrast, size, or spacing to establish a clear hierarchy between primary and secondary actions."
